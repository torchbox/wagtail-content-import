Previously, pickers listened for the 'click' event on the import button but we have now added a new event called 'openPicker'.

Submitting a New Picker If you're planning on submitting a new picker - apps which enable choosing and importing a file from a remote source - you'll need to follow this blueprint: Overview and File Structure Inside wagtail_content_import.pickers , your app should have the following structure: my_picker static wagtail_content_import MY_PICKER.js templates wagtail_content_import MY_PICKER_js_init.html __init__.py apps.py utils.py wagtail_hooks.py Where MY_PICKER should be replaced with the name of your picker. MY_PICKER.js provides the JavaScript class for your picker, which will select a file and make a POST request to the page with relevant data using a hidden form MY_PICKER_js_init.html creates an instance of that class on the Create page, using a template filled in with the relevant settings, and sets up a listener to call that class's .show() method on clicking the relevant import button. __init__.py and apps.py set your app's name and label. utils.py adds your Python picker class, eg GooglePicker wagtail_hooks.py registers your picker using a Wagtail hook, and adds a before_create_page hook to actually take the POST-ed document data and import it, using a parser. The following examples will follow a picker which needs a variable AUTH_PARAMETERS available in the JavaScript in order to import content. MY_PICKER.js This adds the JavaScript class for your picker, and adds it to the window.
